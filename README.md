## Usage

```
$ ./anki-csv-importer.py -h
usage: anki-csv-importer.py [-h] [-p PATH] [-u URL] -d DECK -n NOTE -c COL
                            [--allow-html]

Import a local or remote CSV file into Anki

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PATH, --path PATH  the path of the local CSV file
  -u URL, --url URL     the URL of the remote CSV file
  -d DECK, --deck DECK  the name of the deck to import the sheet to
  -n NOTE, --note NOTE  the card type to import
  -c COL, --col COL     the path to the .anki2 collection
  --allow-html          render HTML instead of treating it as plaintext
```

## Instructions

1. Install Python 3 and `pip3`
1. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/gsingh93/anki-csv-importer`) or download and unzip the source code from [here](https://github.com/gsingh93/anki-csv-importer/archive/master.zip)
1. Open a terminal in the source code directory and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Make sure Anki is not running and run one of the commands below. The double quotes in the command are required if the parameters contain any spaces or special characters. If the specified deck does not exist, it will be created
    1. For a local CSV file run `./anki-csv-importer.py --path "<path>" --deck "<deck_name>" --note "<note_type>" --col "<collection_path>"`
    1. For a remote CSV file run `./anki-csv-importer.py --url "<url>" --deck "<deck_name>" --note "<note_type>" --col "<collection_path>"`. See [this section](#getting-the-csv-url-for-a-google-sheet) to get the CSV URL for a Google Sheet
1. Open Anki and view the deck to confirm the import was successful

Note: your collection **will not** be synced to AnkiWeb until the Anki application is opened.

### `collection_path`

To find the value for `collection_path`, see [the Anki documentation](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/files?id=file-locations) to see where the Anki folder for your system is:

> On Windows, the latest Anki versions store your Anki files in your appdata folder. You can access it by opening the file manager, and typing %APPDATA%\Anki2 in the location field. Older versions of Anki stored your Anki files in a folder called Anki in your Documents folder.
>
> On Mac computers, recent Anki versions store all their files in the ~/Library/Application Support/Anki2 folder. The Library folder is hidden by default, but can be revealed in Finder by holding down the option key while clicking on the Go menu. If youâ€™re on an older Anki version, your Anki files will be in your Documents/Anki folder.
>
> On Linux, recent Anki versions store your data in ~/.local/share/Anki2, or $XDG_DATA_HOME/Anki2 if you have set a custom data path. Older versions of Anki stored your files in ~/Documents/Anki or ~/Anki.

Then add `<profile_name>/collection.anki2` to that path. For example, if your profile is named `Foo` and you are on MacOS, the `collection_path` would be `~/Library/Application Support/Anki2/Foo/collection.anki2`

### Getting the CSV URL for a Google Sheet

1. Create a new Google Sheet or open an existing Sheet
2. Click the "Share" button, followed by "Get shareable link", and then "Anyone with the link can view"
3. Open the developer tools in your browser and open the "Network" tab
4. In Google Sheets click "File -> Download -> Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet)"
5. Right click on the network request in the developer tools and click "Copy -> Copy link address" (for Chrome, instructions may vary for other browsers)

### CSV format

Each column of the CSV corresponds to a field in a note. No header row is needed, the first row can be the data for the first note. After all the columns for the note fields, the next column is for tags.

For example, if the note has the three fields `question`, `answer`, `some_field`, then the CSV file should look something like
```
question1,answer1,some_field1,tags1
question2,answer2,some_field1,tags1
...
```

If the CSV contains more columns than the number of fields in the specified note plus one (for the tags field), they will be ignored. If there are less columns in the CSV than in the note, they will be blank in the note.

### HTML Formatting

By default HTML is displayed as plaintext and not rendered. If you would like to render it, you can use the `--allow-html` flag. For example, to add a link to `https://google.com` in a field, use `<a href="https://google.com">https://google.com</a>`. When using `--allow-html`, you must make sure your HTML formatting is correct or notes can be incorrectly imported into Anki. To display HTML as plaintext while `--allow-html` is enabled, you can use [HTML escape entities](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp). For example, to display `<b>` as plaintext, you would enter `&lt;b&gt;`.

## How sheet modifications are handled

This is the default behavior of Anki's `TextImporter`:

- When a new row is added or an existing question changed in the Google Sheet, a new note is added to the Anki deck
- When any column other than the question is updated in the Google Sheet, the note in the deck is updated with the new fields. Review time does not change.
- When a Google Sheet row is deleted, it's not deleted from the Anki deck

## Notes

- This script should theoretically work on MacOS, Windows, and Linux, but it has only been tested on MacOS
- Adding media to notes is not supported
- If you would like to keep your Anki deck continuously in sync with a remote CSV file, setup a cron job on MacOS and Linux or a scheduled task on Windows to run the command at some regular interval.
- Use the [Add row to Google Sheets](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/add-row-to-google-sheets/baikkcmfolbapkeefcdccadmelcnijcd) extension to add questions to a Google Sheet while you browse the web, and then use this script to keep that Sheet in sync with Anki
- This program makes changes to your Anki database. Your database could be corrupted through misuse of the script, a software bug, or due to the fact that the version of the Anki Python library installed with `pip` may not match the version shipped with your installation of Anki. **Use at your own risk**, if you are concerned about data loss make a backup of the collection at the `collection_path` above and restore this backup if your collection becomes corrupted.

## TODO

- Is it possible to use the Python library shipped with Anki instead of installing it with pip?
- Is it possible to trigger an AnkiWeb sync from this script?
